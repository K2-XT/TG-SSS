TG-SSS is a simple first-person-shooter where you play as a blue swat-member fighting a bunch of red swat-members. The one and only gamemode is Free-For-All, so everyone is trying to murder each other. There are two maps, Arena and Desert, and the first to 25 wins. There is a time limit of five minutes. The TTK is pretty high with this, so don't get frustrated if the people you're shooting aren't dying, just find a hunting rifle on the map and you should find that TTK is about 4 shots with that.

This project originally began by following this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0cLF8gjBprG6487lxqSq-aEo6ZXLDLg I followed the tutorial to completion, and then dabbled into this AI tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRBWFaQHaW__LcCtV-KnqqgIFOyyFhr5

I went back over the code that I learned from DevSquad and refactored it, combining things into functions, making the blueprints look nicer, taking out some unnecessary code... but not nearly enough. There's still a good amount of mess within this project, such as my weapons needing better inheritence, the AI needing a lot of work, and in general just a lot of functions that could use changing.

Still, in the end, I am very proud of this project. It is the first time that I was able to get something of this magnitude off the ground. Sure, I had some help from tutorials, but I really improved off the bases they gave me. A particularly proud moment for myself was making the AI target each other as well, rather than just the player. In general, the AI was what gave me the most headache, and the most pride. Even if they are just little ADHD SWAT guys running around a field shooting at a target that may have moved. I added weapons, game modes, scoreboards, a main menu, it was a lot of fun. There is a significant amount of improvement between this project and my VR Bookcase, and I hope to one day come back to this project and clean it up to be more presentable.
